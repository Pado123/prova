# Experience-Based Resource Allocation for Remaining Time Optimization
Code related to the implementation of the paper ''Experience-Based Resource Allocation for Remaining Time Optimization''

Code related to the implementation of the Lambda Function, the Experience Based Oracle Function, and the Profiles generation.

# Installation 

The code has been developed and tested on Linux 22.04 LTS. With a Python 3.10.2 environment. 
The laptop running the code has 16GB of RAM and an Intel Core i7-10750H CPU @ 2.60GHz Ã— 12.
For storing all the Profiles generated, we used the SSD memory of the laptot, with 1TB of space.

The code for testing the recommendations is at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RecsSysBPSEvaluator-256B.
